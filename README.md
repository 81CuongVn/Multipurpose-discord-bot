# Multipurpose-discord-bot
A multipurpose bot, a clan bot, a all in one bot. The one bot u need for ur server originally made as Milrato discord Bot and by Tomato6966. 


Once i've finished the clustering-sharding method which will be using mongo db instead (and potentially is faster then the main - sqlite version) this repository will be released

The cluster manager will be: https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-hybrid-sharding
Which you can combine with: https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-cross-hosting
As well as with: https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-cross-ratelimit

So you will be able to host the bot on multiple vps and still be able to mind the ratelimits etc.
